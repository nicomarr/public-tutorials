   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Before we dive into a few use cases, let's first review what tool or function calling is and how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the process of tool / function calling involves multiple steps, as illustrated below: \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1.** Flowchart of a basic LLM-powered application with function calling, illustrating the process from user input to final response generation.\n",
    "![Figure 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicomarr/nicomarr.github.io/gh-pages/assets/img/fucntion-calling.svg)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool / function calling:**\n",
    "The LLM receives a system message with core instructions (often including an assigned role), the user prompt, and a description of available functions with their parameters.\n",
    "If the tool call is made in the middle of a conversation, the LLM also receives as input the conversation history of the session (i.e., since the initialization of the assistant or since the last reset). Otherwise, LLMs are stateless (i.e., they do not have persistent memory of previous interactions).\n",
    "When using Scholaris, the conversation history is automatically stored in an attribute of the `Assistant` class, called `conversation_history`. \n",
    "Be sure to check out the [documentation on how to access and use the conversation history](https://nicomarr.github.io/scholaris/#conversation-history).\n",
    "Importantly, the LLM does not \"see\" the source code for execution. Instead, it receives a description of the purpose and usage of a code element, like a Python function, usually provided as text formatted using JSON. \n",
    "The content of this JSON-formatted string is equivalent to the \"docstring\". \n",
    "It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure proper functionality. Based on the user prompt, the LLM returns the most suitable function name and its parameters for the Python interpreter to execute. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Execution of the selected tool / function:**\n",
    "The Python code for the selected function or tool (and any nested functions) is executed, using optional or required parameters provided by the LLM.\n",
    "These functions may be designed to retrieve data from external databases, extract information from local files, or perform tasks like listing the contents of a specific directory. \n",
    "Scholaris includes several [built-in tools](https://nicomarr.github.io/scholaris/#tools) that can be called by the LLM, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t- `get_file_names` \n",
    "\t- `extract_text_from_pdf` \n",
    "\t- `get_titles_and_first_authors` \n",
    "\t- `summarize_local_document` \n",
    "\t- `describe_python_code` \n",
    "\t- `id_converter_tool` \n",
    "\t- `query_openalex_api` \n",
    "\t- `query_semantic_scholar_api` \n",
    "\t- `respond_to_generic_queries`\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Response generation:** \n",
    "Finally, the LLM is \"called\" again to generate a response based on the output of the executed function, the user prompt, and the conversation history as context (which also includes the system message).\n",
    "A programmer can extend this step by implementing additional routines and logic, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Self-reflection** - a mechanism that can be implemented, allowing the LLM to evaluate the response it generated for accuracy and completeness, and repeat the response generation, if necessary. \n",
    "\t- **Iterative loops** - can be implemented, which call additional functions or prompt the user for more details, creating an iterative process by which the response is refined.\n",
    "\t- **Multi-step problem solving** - for complex queries. A workflow can be designed that breaks down tasks into multiple steps. \n",
    "\tDifferent functions might be called in sequence or in parallel to gather all necessary information before a comprehensive response is formulated.\n",
    "\t- **Integration of multiple function outputs** - can be combined, allowing information from different sources to be synthesized to provide a more holistic answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "These additional steps are not part of the core functionality of Scholaris and would need to be implemented by the user. \n",

    "unless you want to implement more complex logic and agentic workflows, including multi-step reasoning and/or loops (more on this below).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Scholaris](https://pypi.org/project/scholaris/) is developed to serve as a framework for building LLM-powered research assistants in health and life sciences rather than a robust production-ready tool. \n",
    "Therefore, you may also modify the existing tools and functions or add similar tools to extend the assistant's capabilities. \n",
    "Consider using the assistance of an LLM to modify the provided core functions to suit your specific research needs. To do so, you may use larger cloud-hosted LLMs to aid you in this process, although for simple modifications, smaller (local) models may suffice.\n",
    "For example, you can modify the `summarize_local_document` function to extract specific information from a document that is relevant to your research by modifying the prompt used inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always use LLMs responsibly and be aware of their limitations. Use additional models, such as [Llama Guard](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama-guard-3/), in production environments to ensure that the assistant does not generate harmful or inappropriate content."
