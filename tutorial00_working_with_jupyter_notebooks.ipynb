This notebook will focus on [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), as it is the most widely used programming language in the data science community. Jupyter notebooks also support a variety of other programming languages, such as:\n",
    "- [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/) - a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.\n",
    "- [**Mojo**](https://www.modular.com/mojo) - a new language and superset of Python designed for AI and machine learning.\n",

    "> Note: If you are running this notebook on your local machine, it is recommended to create and use a virtual environment before running code cells with `%pip` statements below. It is best practice to create a new environment for any new project or workflow. This will help you avoid conflicts with existing packages on your system. Use **Conda** if you are working with multiple programming languages. Quick command line instructions on how to install **Miniconda**, a free minimal installer for **Conda**, can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install). You can ignore this step if you are using **Google Colab** to run this notebook."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Types of Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Cells**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: These cells are used to write and execute code. When you run a code cell, the code is sent to the kernel, which processes it and returns the output.\n",
    "   - **Interaction with Modes**: In Edit Mode, you can write your code. In Command Mode, you can run the code cell, or move it up, or down.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Markdown Cells**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: These cells are for writing text, explanations, and formatting. You can include headings, lists, and even equations using Markdown syntax.\n",
    "   - **Interaction with Modes**: In Edit Mode, you can type and format your text. In Command Mode, you can convert a code cell to a markdown cell or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **Edit Mode**: Allows you to write and edit content in all cell types.\n",
    "- **Command Mode**: Enables you to manage cells, run code, and change cell types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how these modes interact with different cell types helps you use Jupyter Notebooks more effectively. You can easily switch between writing code, formatting text, and managing your notebook's structure.\n"

    "- Debugging\n",

    "- ome commands may behave differently across platforms\n",
    "- Cell magic (%%) must be the first line in a cell\n",
    "- Line magic (%) can appear anywhere in a line"
